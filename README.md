# Accessibility acceptance criteria: page and user-flow level

Page and user-flow level acceptance criteria are testable checks that apply to full pages or complete user-flows. They can be used to ensure accessibility is considered and tested across entire journeys, not just individual components.

## Where can then be used?

- During design reviews of entire pages or flows.
- In user stories, epics, and sprint tickets.
- As part of the “Definition of Done”.
- As part of QA and UAT testing for full journeys.

## Who owns page and user-flow accecptance criteria?

- POs and BAs: define expected outcomes for pages and user journeys.
- Designers: ensure accessible design across pages and user journeys.
- Developers: implement accessibility across pages and user journeys.
- Testers/QAs: verify pages and user journeys meet expectations.
